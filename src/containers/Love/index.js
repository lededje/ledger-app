        <p>This is an initial proof of concept to show what a bank ui could be like. More experiments will be added here, and when the APIs allow for public release, you can login a review your own transactions too. Features to come include being able to save filters into segments, setting up alerts for those segments and dashboards showing you at a glance spending. If you have any other suggestions, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:ledger@likeminded.io">ledger@likeminded.io</a></p>

        <p>If your from intercom please ping me a message, it would be great to chat.</p>
